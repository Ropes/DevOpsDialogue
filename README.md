# DevOpsDialogue

Repository for tuning template documentation for bridging the gaps between Development and Operations. Documentation releaves pressure pushing engineers into silos of responsibility, since others can take over and understand basics and Standard Operating Procedures of a service. People forget, designs mutate, questions don't get asked early enough, and things die in new ways. Standardized documentation helps get important questions asked early before there's a panic in production.

The term "DevOps" is a fundamentally divisive term which attempts to bridge gaps between different engineering groups. However many organizations are beginning to realize that the two shouldn't be separate. If it runs in production, the typical Development silo needs to be involved with covering Operational issues that can arrise.

This project attempts to create documentation templates to facilitate answering questions that all engineering groups should be aware of before a service goes into a production environment.
